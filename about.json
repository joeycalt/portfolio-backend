    "bio": "Joey Caltabellotta graduated from General Assembly in 2022. Afterwords, he went to work for Google where he maintained a full-stack application using React and Expresss. He also recently started learning Python, cause why not waste time. I am also currently working on a portfolio using both front end and back end applications. On the side, not for class but on my own free will, I am creating a website for my Fantasy Football League so the league can be caught up with whats going on. When not practing with coding to become the best there is, I enjoy going on day trips with my girlfriend and my new puppy, or you can catch me on the golf course trying my hardest to not lose more than 10 golf balls."
